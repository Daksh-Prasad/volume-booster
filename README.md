# volume-booster
This Chrome extension boosts the volume of audio and video on webpages beyond the usual limits. Using a simple slider in the popup, users can adjust the volume boost from 1x to 5x, applying the effect directly to media elements for a louder listening experience. Created by Daksh Prasad.
